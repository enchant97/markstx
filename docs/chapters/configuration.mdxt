In the root file of every document you can set certain parameters to control certain features, for example setting the title or controlling the page size.

In MarkstX this is set by providing YAML frontmatter at the top of the root file. An example is shown below:

```
---
doc:
    title: "My Document"
---

The document contents here...
```
